# Lesson_Notes

This repository will host some LaTeX files of notes and other resources of lessons which I've taken in USTC, including Stochastic Process(B), Quantum Physics to date. Also, I put my preamble here.

I will not update it so often because I'm new to GitHub and Git. Laziness is another reason too.
